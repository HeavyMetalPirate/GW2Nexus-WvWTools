# GW2Nexus WvW Tools

Addon that has some widgets and tools around World vs. World.

### Features
The following features are available:
- Pips calculator: calculate how long you are going until you complete the diamond skirmish track
- Kill/Death ratio: mini widget that shows current matchup K/D
- Auto Pips Calculator widget: approximate auto calculation of how long until the diamond skirmish track is done
  - This requires ArcDPS for full operation
  - This also requires you to set your current WvW alliance in the options
  - It will learn your current level and skirmish progression during normal gameplay
  - If it detects a new matchup, it will adjust the progress accordingly
  - The result is an approximation; the auto calculator does a best effort approach to calculate the time left and should be treated as general guideline rather than a definite result
  - See the options screen for a detailed explanation

### Planned Features
- Matchup inspector
- Matchup prediction for the next week
- Stats widgets (i.e. victory points ranking, map stats, ...)
- (Possible/Needs verification) Map facts (i.e. objective informations on current map)
